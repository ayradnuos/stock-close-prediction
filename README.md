# Stock closing movement prediction

Stock markets are dynamic and competitive arenas where timing is everything. Things really heat up as the trading day winds down, especially in those last crucial ten minutes. The highly volatile prices in those precious minutes shape the economic narrative on a global scale.
In this project, we delve into this captivating world of financial markets to forecast the movement of stock prices at the end of each trading day. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, the aim is to develop predictive models that can anticipate whether a stock's closing price will rise, fall, or remain stable.
